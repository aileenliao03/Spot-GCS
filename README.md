## GCS

For runable examples, see the ```footstep_gcs_..._example.ipynb``` files. There are two examples. One of the examples illustrates a more complicated terrain, but does not well demonstrate the vertex-copy capabilities of the algorithm. The other example illustrates well the vertex-copy capabilities of the algorithm, but for a simple terrain, and does not demonstrate well the overall capabilities of the algorithm. 

The vertex-copy code is nevertheless run in both examples, this is a recent edition for the complicated terrain, and not excessively tested. If the code is behaving strangely, try running it without the "handle_copies" function.
